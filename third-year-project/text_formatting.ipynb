       "\"Confronting the climate crisis and the prospect of humankind’s demise, the veteran experimental musician takes an unconventional approach: He gets in touch with his feelings. Brian Eno is known for many things: pioneering ambient music, famous collaborators, the creative embrace of chance, a sly sense of humor, his love of cats. But you wouldn’t describe him as particularly extroverted or sentimental. He’s not, as some might say, “sad boy emo.” So it’s a little unexpected that his new album, FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE, arrives with an accompanying 375-word statement in which he uses the word “feelings” 13 times. “It took me a long time to embrace the idea that we artists are actually feelings-merchants,” Eno writes, presumably in earnest. “Art is where we start to become acquainted with those feelings, where we notice them and learn from them—learn what we like and don’t like—and from there they start to turn into actionable thoughts.”What has made Eno suddenly so in touch with his inner child? Oh, just the dying planet and the prospect of humankind’s demise. “I’ve been thinking about our narrowing, precarious future, and this music grew out of those thoughts. Perhaps it’s more accurate to say I’ve been feeling about it…and the music grew out of the feelings”—bold text Eno’s. Underpinning FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE is a theory, one you have to admire for its sheer lack of cynicism: By redirecting our emotional impulses toward the planet and away from ourselves, we’ll have a greater chance of reversing the Earth’s environmental trajectory.This suggestion is so uncharacteristically hippie-dippie that I feared Eno might, at best, create a patchwork of nature sounds along the lines of Irv Teibel’s Environments series or, at worst, cover “Big Yellow Taxi.” But what’s curious about FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE is how little warmth or whimsy the music exudes. In 1975, on his most treasured vocal-based album, Another Green World, Eno created “pop” songs and sound pieces that obliquely imagined the world’s various topographies and ecologies. Almost 50 years later, he’s explicitly addressing the Earth, but he’s producing the sonic equivalent of an icy tundra.FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE has been touted as Eno’s first primarily vocal-based LP since 2005’s Another Day on Earth, but that’s a little misleading. The singing isn’t straightforwardly melodic; it’s just one more textural layer in smoothly reverberating sound design that’s full of arcing synth notes, periodic pings and chimes, and shimmering background tones. There’s no percussion, no major chords, and no choruses or bridges. Typically, Eno will lay out verses in threes, slightly altering the lyrics each time, like Jewish prayers or dissolving mantras. On opening track “Who Gives a Thought,” for example, he recites the title at the start of each verse to ask rhetorical questions about fireflies, nematodes (an invertebrate otherwise known as a roundworm), and laborers. The implication throughout is that the vocal melodies and lyrics are meant to induce a meditative state, but the arrangements are so mercurial—slight effects intervene suddenly and randomly—that anything approaching zen is impossible. As glossily stark as the album might be, the music isn’t entirely grim. Some of it is plainly gorgeous. Even when he’s intoning apocalyptic imagery on “There Were Bells” (“There were those who ran away/There were those who had to stay/In the end they all went the same way”), Eno fills the background with chirping birdsong. The very next track, “Sherry,” has a melody structured like one of longtime Eno collaborator Robert Wyatt’s, gently curling around a Rhodes-like keyboard, starry guitar licks, and a distant vocal patch that recalls Aphex Twin’s “#1” on Selected Ambient Works Vol. II. Incidentally, Eno wields that vocal effect most remarkably on one of the album’s two wordless songs. On closer “Making Gardens Out of Silence,” initially composed for an exhibit at London’s Serpentine gallery, eight and a half minutes of undulating synths, strings, and sustained vocal tones bear the otherworldly, transportive qualities of Eno’s Apollo or his Ambient series.Eno once again has collaborated with Leo Abrahams, Peter Chilvers, and Jon Hopkins, three people he’s consistently worked with in various configurations over the past 15 years. At times you can parse their contributions immediately: Abrahams’ shimmering guitar textures, Chilvers’ Bloom-like sound effects, and Hopkins’ seismic synth-bass rips. These are all skilled musicians with unique perspectives, but their involvement is the album’s one drawback. As an artist, Eno is famous for his sonic “treatments'' and for his willingness to venture into unfamiliar territory, but for all of the record’s virtues, it’s a little too treated, a little too familiar; at times it verges on being a little too antiseptic. Eno’s written statement and the gravity of the subject indicate a grand departure, but FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE feels nonetheless like a continuation of his work since the mid to late 2000s.Speaking of the 2000s, when I listen to FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE, I’m reminded of David Sylvian’s 2003 album Blemish, which similarly used wintry electronic music and off-target singing to evoke devastation, though in that case it concerned the dissolution of a relationship. Crucially, Sylvian offset his blistering laptop electronica with Derek Bailey’s fractured, improvised acoustic guitar, giving Blemish a distinct tension. But what they both have in common is a pronounced sense of intimacy, and in Eno’s case a familial one—his niece Cecily appears as a vocalist, and his granddaughter’s handwriting features prominently in the video for the song “We Let It In.” It’s exactly the kind of unconventional thinking people have come to expect from Eno: an album about something vast and daunting, made with and for the people closest to you.\""

       "'The hotly tipped 20-year-old singer-songwriter debuts with a cool, confident record that occasionally blends into pleasant monotony. After releasing her debut single “Cola” in 2018, 20-year-old London poet Arlo Parks won the approval of virtually every possible tastemaker. Michelle Obama put her on a playlist; Hayley Williams nearly included her as a tour opener, and Phoebe Bridgers covered Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees” with Parks on piano and harmonies. While prepping her debut album, Parks collaborated with festival favorites Glass Animals and R&B newcomers MICHELLE. It’s not hard to see why she has so much support; Parks’ songwriting is affectionate and friendly, never straining too hard, always cool and collected. Nearly every song has a message of comfort—on the opener, she sings, “You shouldn’t be afraid to cry in front of me,” while the chorus of “Hope” goes, “You’re not alone/Like you think you are,” over light trip-hop. In a vacuum, any one of these songs are charming, but on Collapsed in Sunbeams, they all blur into a pleasant sort of monotony.As a songwriter, Parks uses pop culture references and proper nouns as shorthand to set scenes, hoping to build “a complete world that people can immerse themselves in.” This is often endearing; the pre-album single “Cola” mentioned Gerard Way, and the clunkiness of “I’d lick the grief right off your lips/You do your eyes like Robert Smith” on “Black Dog” just makes the song feel more intimate. In a lot of instances, those attempts at immersion get so repetitive that they ironically serve as distractions. There are so many names—Charlie, Caroline, Millie—that it’s hard to keep track, and there are so many references and words of affirmation that it’s hard to remember who said what to whom. It doesn’t help that songs like “Hurt” (the Charlie one) are aimless sketches about aimless characters, where the point is that the references and platitudes don’t add up to anything.Parks’ eclectic influences show up in her lyrics (Thom Yorke, Nujabes, and Jai Paul all get name-drops), but not her music. Whether the producer is Paul Epworth or usual collaborator Gianluca Buccellati, everything sounds too sweet. Every other song has a dry drum kit with atmospheric vinyl cracks and floaty keyboards. Even the moments that change things up feel undercooked: “Just Go” is extremely light disco, while “Porta 400” opens with a string sample that almost immediately disappears in the mix. The distorted bass of “For Violet” sounds like it might lead to something darker, worthy of the Massive Attack on Parks’ playlist, but within 45 seconds Parks is back to geniality: “Wait/You know when college starts again you’ll manage!” “Violet” is one of a handful of moments where the comforting atmosphere starts to crack—it hints at a more compelling album actively at war with its own themes. The breakthrough “Dog” depicts helping someone through a mental health crisis (“At least I know that you are trying/But that’s what makes it terrifying”), but on “Violet,” she gives up on helping, instead repeating, “Nothing’s changing and I can’t do this, I can’t do this.” The best songs flip the formula altogether, finding universality in specific themes instead of dressing up universal themes in specific imagery. Early single “Eugene” adds a layer of complexity and heartbreak to a traditional pop subject: Parks’ character falls for a straight girl, a painful variation on unrequited love where reciprocation is inherently impossible. On “Green Eyes,” the love is reciprocated, but ends after two months in fear of homophobic attacks. When Parks inevitably offers a platitude—“You gotta trust how you feel inside and shine”—there are actual stakes to give those lines some meaning.Repeated listens further reveal the weight missing from the production and melodies: When she stands up for herself on penultimate track “Bluish,” there are few pop-culture references or proper nouns, just simple and effective lines like “never had the chance to miss you” and “please let me out of you.” Sunbeams could use more of that directness. Otherwise, it’s easy to imagine someone walking into a coffee shop, nodding their head to the supportive chorus wafting over the speakers, and never thinking about it again.'"

       "\"On their ninth album, the twins revisit their roots, re-recording demos they wrote as teenagers and polishing them into poignant synth-pop gems. In 1998, Tegan and Sara caused a small stir when they won a Calgary, Alberta talent contest called Garage Warz. The identical twins appeared on a local news segment to talk excitedly about their win, draped in capacious clothing and distinguishable by Sara’s long hair and Tegan’s lip piercing. “The thing that I like the best,” said Sara, “is that, I don’t think that [the judges] think, ‘Wow, they’re perfect, they [need] no improvement’... I think they just see maybe a sparkle of something, that can get to be something bigger.”Even in her wide-eyed hopefulness, Sara probably didn’t imagine that the duo would go on to have a storied 20-year career: first as Canadian grunge-folk darlings, then pop-punk rebels embraced by the White Stripes and Paramore, and later as synth-pop troubadours joining Taylor Swift onstage. On Tegan and Sara’s ninth studio album, Hey, I'm Just Like You—and the simultaneously released High School, a co-written memoir about their time dropping acid and moshing to Green Day in the ’90s—they revisit their roots, re-recording demos they wrote as teenagers. This time, they’re both the open-hearted teenage songwriters and the wiser industry professionals who can spot, and expand on, their spark.It’s a smart move for a band whose fan base has both aged with them, and continually refreshed itself with younger members. At a Tegan and Sara show, you’re as likely to meet women in their 30s or 40s who have been die-hard fans of the trailblazing LGBTQ icons since the opening guitar strums of “You Wouldn’t Like Me” in 2004 as you are to meet younger listeners who caught the wave with their 2016 breakthrough pop hit “Boyfriend.” On Hey, I’m Just Like You, the band seem to acknowledge and speak to each of these audiences at once. Listening to the title track in its plaintive, unvarnished demo form, it’s clear that it was written by the same two girls who, as described in their memoir, once built a shrine to Kurt Cobain. On the album, the song opens with sharp claps, and builds to a synth-spangled chorus that cushions the jagged melancholy of the original in a pop cocoon.As well as reconciling their different sounds, the album is a fierce reminder of the twins’ ability to write an irresistible chorus. Particularly memorable ones here include the stadium-sized exhalation of “I Don’t Owe You Anything,” the bratty moshpit-lite chorus of “Hold My Breath Until I Die,” and the angst-ridden, fist-pumping “I Know I’m Not the Only One.”  On “Don’t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie),” a clunky title becomes a surprisingly great refrain when the song breaks open, halfway through, into a widescreen anthemic surge. “Don’t Believe…” is not the album’s only clunky phrasing. Glancing through the track list is like flicking through a teen’s journal, with its powerful “get off my case, Mom” energy. The album’s general embrace of Tegan and Sara’s teenage earnestness is mostly its strength, but there are moments that grate: the “hello, hello, hello” hook on “Hello, I’m Right Here” carries strange hints of the “British whine” that Sara recalls their teenage voices carrying in High School. On the electronic bounce of “You Go Away and I Don’t Mind,” the stripped-back production gives the juvenile, baffling opening lyrics (“I’m complicated, I was raised by icons”) nowhere to hide.On “Don’t Believe…,” however, they strike the right balance between the clumsy originality of the song that Sara says she wrote in 1995, at age 15, and the polished pros they are now. The melodrama of the chorus (“I belong”) is muted, filtering the pain of teenagerhood through refined adult tastes. There’s a radical kind of self-acceptance to honoring your goofy and heartbreaking teenage sentiments with such seriousness. Sara recently told the Guardian that she has a lot of “self-hatred” and “internalized homophobia” stemming from her difficult high school years, but that revisiting the music and memories of the time—rather than embarrassing her as much as she expected—helped her to love herself. “I’m so amazed at what that person accomplished, knowing that inside they were really, really damaged.”The fact that these songs have been interpreted by their writers 20 years later creates a layer of knowing poignancy, such as when Tegan sings, “I wonder if someday, we'll just be a memory?” on “I Know I’m Not...,” or when Sara sings “What if I become all of the horrible things that I said I would never be?” on the delicate “Please Help Me.” The sting of their adolescent fears is softened both by the heightened shimmer of the production, and by the very fact that we know how this story ends. Compare the gentle, winking nature of the line “Right now, I wish I was older” on “Hello, I’m Right Here,” to the brute force of Billie Eilish—still in the thick of all-encompassing young turmoil—singing about wishing she could be someone else. Memories of the very real pain and passion we felt as teenagers become cool enough to touch when we’re older. In Tegan and Sara’s hands, they become mantras, glimmering and hopeful and full of sparkle.\""

       "'The ranging album from the Philadelphia songwriter adopts a drifting mind as its emotional compass. There’s no rush to get where he’s going, and he rarely checks to see if you’re still following along. Nestled into Side A of Kurt Vile’s seventh solo album, Bottle It In, is “Bassackwards,” 10 minutes of warped, psychedelic folk-rock, like a long sigh in the face of existential dread. Some songwriters seek wisdom in their aimlessness—reflecting on what they could have done better, trying to pinpoint what went wrong. But there’s no moral to Vile’s story; he wallows, unapologetically. To a slow-pulsing chord progression, like Tom Petty’s “Swingin’” played on the moon, the 38-year-old Philadelphia songwriter repeats himself and gets distracted before losing his train of thought completely. As he drifts through space, he sounds confused, resigned, distant. It’s one of his best songs yet.This track, and its circuitous path toward nothingness, is a key insight into the mind of Kurt Vile. A lot of his lyrics take place in the early hours of the day, those bleary, pre-coffee moments, when nobody else is around, that have always somehow inspired his clearest thoughts. Over the last decade, Vile’s musical evolution from scuzzy, self-recorded doodles to fuller, brighter vistas has resembled a diary composed entirely of late-summer weekend mornings: He seeks comfortability over clarity, with anxiety creeping in but never quite blocking the light. Or as he puts it in “Bassackwards,” “The sun went down, and I couldn’t find another one… for a while.”Recorded gradually throughout America while Vile was on tour over the last three years, Bottle It In adopts a drifting mind as its emotional compass. The scenery changes, but Vile’s dazed, half-smile remains constant. “One Trick Ponies” is a bouncy highlight about friendship and the joys of repetition, as Vile depicts the span of life as a “song, if the repeats were long.” Communicating in a chewy monotone that’s more for zoning out than singing along, he still writes lyrics that feel like predictive text: “What a world we’ve inherited/From another mother/What a whale of a pickle.” So over Bottle It In’s 80 minutes, he manages to communicate very little, yet the mood is immediately identifiable: slow, smoky, heady. There’s no rush to get where he’s going, and he rarely checks to see if you’re still following along.While Bottle It In—Vile’s longest, most introspective record—lacks the quiet beauty of 2011’s Smoke Ring for My Halo, the warmth of 2013’s Wakin on a Pretty Daze, or the immediacy of 2015’s b’lieve i’m goin’ down…, its monolithic Kurtness is its own defining quality. In a recent New York Times interview, he jokingly compared the record to Bruce Springsteen’s multi-platinum Born in the U.S.A. Of course, nothing sounds like a “Dancing in the Dark”-style breakthrough, but there is a sense of comprehensiveness, each song zooming into a different, hazy corner of his psyche. The result feels like an extended hang alone with Kurt in a dark basement. Here, he’s less likely to summon the energy for a jam like 2009’s “Freak Train” and more likely to, say, crack a joke about avoiding parking tickets (“Loading Zones”) or gush about being in love while ripping noisy guitar solos for 10-plus minutes (“Skinny Mini”). At a certain point, though, the air can get a little stale. To keep things fresh, he enlists the help of Cass McCombs, Kim Gordon, and Warpaint’s Stella Mozgawa, though often in barely noticeable ways. Only harpist Mary Lattimore steals the show, ascending the free-floating title track into a menacing, regenerative anti-epic. Yet Bottle It In rotates entirely around Vile. Just as you couldn’t mistake his voice or lyrics for anyone else’s, his silvery, shapeshifting guitar remains a defining sound in modern indie rock. When his compositions feel like thoughts in progress, his guitar speaks to the intensity bubbling just under the surface.At its best, Bottle It In pairs music with message to create a new tension in Vile’s work. The anti-technology lyrics of “Mutinies” are fairly simple (“I think things were way easier with a regular telephone,” he mutters), but the arrangement is complex and colorful, building to a droning sunshower that envelopes his words. “Cold Was the Wind,” meanwhile, furthers his penchant for rambling about his rambles, but its arrangement is one of his darkest, most unsettling studio concoctions yet. It could pass for a spidery Tom Waits demo or the theme for an HBO miniseries about a sad detective.And then, of course, there’s “Bassackwards.” It’s the beautiful, banal peak of the record, a warning for the purposeful meandering that follows. The album’s structure—with its more accessible tracks up front and a meditative, somewhat indulgent back-half—can feel like a conversation slipping silently into sighing and nodding. At the end of “Bassackwards,” he mumbles, “Just the way things is these days/Just the way things come out.” It’s the type of thing you say when you’re bored and trying to change the subject but it also serves his momentary thesis statement. Vile has long embraced such in-between moments—he’s just never sounded so lost in one.'"

       "'Born in the Echoes continues the creative resurgence ignited by the Chemical Brothers\\' brilliant last full-length, 2010’s\\xa0Further. In contrast to that album\\'s loved-up euphoria,\\xa0Echoes\\xa0is a grab bag: Festival fillers and club bangers rub up against wondrously bizarre studio experiments and some of the best pure pop songs Rowlands and Simons have ever made. \"The future? I’ll see you there!\" These words come in the middle of the latest album from London dance music survivors the Chemical Brothers. It could be a sly nod to their influence on this decade’s global electronic boom. Back in the mid-1990s, acts like the Chems, Fatboy Slim, and the Prodigy were primed to vanquish guitar rock once and for all while ushering in a squelching age of rave. It didn’t work out that way and, soon enough, Limp Bizkit were dragging their knuckles all the way to the top of the charts. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons’ radical mix of acid house, hip-hop, and shaggy psych was deemed just another pop fad. But now, with EDM festivals drawing millions of fans around the world and spiritual big beat descendants like Diplo and Hudson Mohawke helping to shape the Hot 100, it’s clear that the Chemical Brothers were both ambassadors and soothsayers. And they’re still around. They deserve to gloat.Then again, the line could also suggest something more sinister. It’s taken from a spoken-word performance by iconoclastic 76-year-old Canadian poet bill bissett, whose idea of \"the future\" involves scentless flowers, two-headed babies, and other marks of a hellish apocalypse; for every hit of ecstatic futurism, they seem to be saying, there is an equal and opposite dose of reality. Meanwhile, the music of \"I’ll See You There\" finds Rowlands and Simons once again tripping out on the past, as howled backmasking and frenzied drums criss-cross in an effort to once again capture the headiness of their own psychedelic pop ur-text, the Beatles’ \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". All of which leads us to the eternal present—the now—which happens to be a place that suits the Chemical Brothers quite well.Born in the Echoes is the pair’s eighth album and it continues the creative resurgence ignited by their brilliant last full-length, 2010’s Further, which served as something of a career reset following a decade of flagging potency. But whereas that album was marked by extended dancefloor workouts, seamless DJ-style transitions, and an overall feeling of loved-up euphoria, Echoes is more of a grab bag: Enormous festival fillers and hard-nosed club bangers rub up against wondrously bizarre studio experiments and some of the best pure pop songs Rowlands and Simons have ever made.Like fellow \\'90s innovators Daft Punk, the Chems have managed to last more than 20 years in part because they are smart enough to prioritize mindless immediacy. The two upper middle class boys bonded while studying history at Manchester University at the height of the city’s ecstasy heyday; they would read Chaucer’s bawdy Canterbury Tales and then head over to The Haçienda and flail about with 1,000 of their new best friends. They quoted British novelist Evelyn Waugh on an early EP title and then sampled roughneck New York rapper Keith Murray on their ageless classic Dig Your Own Hole. Simons recently returned to the world of academia (and will miss this year’s Chemical Brothers tour dates because of it), while Rowlands recently summed up the duo’s objectives thusly: \"We\\'re just really into making funny sounds and putting them into some kind of order that makes sense … Not every song has to be the meaning of life.\" So on Echoes we get Q-Tip spouting motivational pizza box rhymes over rubberband basslines on future sports montage soundtrack \"Go\" followed by St. Vincent staring into the suicidal void of a performer’s high on \"Under Neon Lights\", which peaks with a guitar (or is it a synth?) solo that searingly recalls \"Bulls on Parade\". We get the viscous funk of \"Taste of Honey\"—replete with buzzing bee cameo—next to the taut title track, which features a coolly distant vocal from Cate Le Bon and sounds like a worthy tribute to the late, great psych auteurs Broadcast. Then Beck shows up at the end to help Rowlands and Simons create the finest New Order song in ages. \"Wide Open\" makes the inevitability of losing it—life, love, inspiration—sound terribly triumphant, and just as the track hits its climax, Beck wisely gets out of the way, making room for undulating waveforms that bristle and burst with all-too-human imperfections.Talking to Spin about his Big Beat contemporaries in 1999, Ed Simons suggested, \"There’s surely going to come a time when those kind of tricks—all the drops and builds and rhythm changes—aren’t going to trigger the same responses in people.\" Of course, the same could be said of today’s insta-nuke dance tracks, the ones that try to cheat death by just running away from it really fast and really hard. And, to be fair, the Chemical Brothers have deployed plenty of drops and builds and rhythm changes across the last two decades. But Rowlands and Simons’ version of the future isn’t one of narrow-minded annihilation; there are levels to it, along with paths that connect everything from the Fab Four to \"Funky Drummer\" to Phuture. Part of a fast-moving culture always looking for the next high, the Chemical Brothers remain steadfast—eyeing the past and future while living in the here and now.'"

       "\"On With a Little Help From My Fwends, the Flaming Lips tackle the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band with help from Miley Cyrus, Tegan and Sara, J. Mascis, Tool’s Maynard James Keenan, My Morning Jacket, Foxygen, Lightning Bolt's Brian Chippendale, and others. These aren’t so much revisions as disembowelments. Back in the mid-1980s, the easiest way for underground bands to draw ideological battlelines separating themselves from their 1970s arena-rock antecedents was to appropriate their most hallowed songs for devious ends. And so we got J. Mascis moaning his way through Peter Frampton’s “Show Me the Way”, the Minutemen chopping Van Halen songs in half, Pussy Galore licking the burnt spoons littered throughout the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street, Sonic Youth swiping the title of CCR’s “Bad Moon Rising” for their Reagan-era state-of-the-union address, and the Butthole Surfers grinding Black Sabbath’s “Sweet Leaf” into skunk weed. In this context, what made the early, garage-punk iteration of the Flaming Lips so strange was not their sordid subject matter, disturbing cover art, or 23-minute acid-rock jams. It was their contrarian reverence for tradition, with the band dropping straight-faced covers of Led Zeppelin’s “Thank You” and Louis Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World” into their repertoire for no other reason than they loved the songs.As the Lips scored sudden mainstream success in the early '90s with a fluke MTV hit, their cover choices turned decidedly more esoteric, as the band used their modicum of celebrity to shine a light on known artists’ lesser-known work, reclaim new-wave novelties, or to promote then-unheralded underground peers. But in the post-Soft Bulletin era—during which the Lips’ music became both more tonally serious and relentlessly experimental—cover songs have become a necessary salve through which the band can reassert their playful side and maintain the circus-like atmosphere at their concerts even when touring behind decidedly more downcast material.And ever since they trotted out old warhorses like “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “War Pigs” on their 2006 At War With the Mystics tour, the Lips have seemingly been on a mission to modernize the entire classic-rock canon, by curating full-album, collaboration-heavy reconstructions of Pink Floyd and King Crimson milestones (with a Stone Roses debut-album redux thrown in to show they’re still fond of music made after 1980). But while such recurring retro-gazing exercises may seem antithetical to the adventurous, boundary-pushing ethos the Lips displayed on 2009’s Embryonic and last year’s The Terror, the mere task of making the most totemic (and, by extension, contemptuously overplayed) rock songs of all time seem fresh presents its own formidable challenge, one they’ve answered by gradually shifting their cover-song approach from faithfully sacred to kill-yer-idols profane. Now comes the greatest challenge of all: tackling the Beatles’ Summer-of-Love soundtrack Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, a generation-defining achievement so masterful that its very title has become the official shorthand descriptor for masterful achievements. The Lips aren’t the first to give Pepper a shake, but even the post-punk/new pop makeover the album received on the 1988 NME-curated comp Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father—complete with Mark E. Smith warbling “A Day in the Life”—feels overly staid and deferential compared to what transpires here. And even by the standards of the Lips’ previous tribute-album overhauls, With a Little From My Fwends is a colossal, chaotic undertaking, its 27-collaborator guest list bringing together pop singers (Miley Cyrus, Tegan & Sara), fellow alt-rock veterans (J. Mascis, Tool’s Maynard James Keenan), Bonnaroo royalty (My Morning Jacket, Dr. Dog), indie phenoms (Foxygen, Phantogram), and maverick MCs (Cool Kid Chuck Inglish), alongside the usual army of Lips affiliates like New Fumes and Stardeath & White Dwarfs. And where previous experiments were limited to Record Store Day releases or iTunes exclusives, this one is a more widely publicized benefit album for the Bella Foundation, an Oklahoma City-based animal shelter that provides crucial veterinary services to low-income pet owners. But while the charitable component lends With a Little From My Fwends a noble purpose beyond just being another Wayne Coyne-commandeered, clown-car-filling amusement, the end result occasionally suggests your time might be better spent revisiting the original album and making a direct donation.One of the great breakthroughs of Sgt. Pepper was how it used the recording studio to create a vivid, three-dimensional sense of space and place, bringing the lyrics to life in audio-storybook form. (Think of the live-concert ambience of the opening title-track “With a Little Help From My Friends” suite, or the carnival-esque clamor of “Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!”; even the clarinet refrain of “When I’m Sixty Four” gives off the musty scent of a grandparent’s house.) But the Lips and Fwends go to town on these songs with little regard for thematic resonance or big-picture atmosphere. In the spirit of the aforementioned 80s-era indie cover-song desecrations, these aren’t so much revisions as disembowelments that replace the guts of the originals with a tangle of short-circuiting exposed wires. And given that the Lips weren’t even around to supervise all of their guest contributions (Coyne and co. actually only appear on a handful of tracks), things undoubtedly get messy quick, if not downright hazardous. With its scatterbrained, kinder-pop take on the title track (which climaxes with an arrhythmic, atonal guitar solo from J. Mascis), and a strangulated call-and-response between Wilco offshoot the Autumn Defense and Lightning Bolt’s Brian Chippendale (aka Black Pus) on “With a Little Help From My Friends”, the project effectively gives Sgt. Pepper the shreds treatment. Of course, even the most successful cover songs in pop history are inherently blasphemous—in that they suggest unexplored avenues that the original could’ve taken, coax lurking undercurrents to the fore, and cast the source material in an entirely new light. But the problem with a lot of these versions is that they’re unruly on just a surface level. Whether it’s the wobbly-kneed Dr. Dog/Morgan Delt/Chuck Inglish gang-up on “Getting Better”, Maynard James Keenan’s inert, industrialized “Mr. Kite!”, or Def Rain and Pitchwafuzz’s vocoderized, static-swirled “When I’m Sixty Four”, the Lips’ Fwends are so intent on tripping up the songs’ rhythmic momentum and weirding up the basic melodies with hammy vocals that they ultimately reinforce their sturdiness. They’re trashing all the furniture in the house, but not bulldozing any walls to open up new vantages.It’s the simple revisions that yield the greatest revelations. The Electric Würms—aka the Lips alter-ego aggregate that promotes Steven Drozd to lead vocalist—recast “Fixing a Hole” as a charmingly low-key psych-folk reverie that amplifies the song’s slow-percolating existential ennui; Stardeath’s stuttering synth-funk take on “Lovely Rita” is given a sly queer spin by guests Tegan and Sara (while their robotic delivery —coupled with the song’s mechanistic motion—craftily adapts the song to a modern world where parking enforcement is largely an automated process). And while Foxygen—with the help of MGMT’s Ben Goldwasser—stretch out the Sgt. Pepper title-track reprise to nearly triple the original’s length (making it even longer than the song it’s supposed to set up, “A Day in the Life”), it’s transformed into precisely the sort of wiggy organ-pumped workout Billy Shears and the boys might have used to close down some imaginary festival set on the Isle of Wight.Ironically, the seemingly most outrageous aspect of this entire endeavour—i.e., the mere presence of Miley Cyrus—proves to be its grounding force. On an album where everyone is trying way too hard to out-freak one another, Cyrus—much like the Led Zep-loving Lips of the '80s—stands out by simply playing it straight (which feels strange in and of itself). Tellingly, she’s entrusted with the album’s two most celebrated songs, turning in effective duets with Coyne on a splendorous, slow-motion surge through “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” and a suitably mournful “A Day in the Life”, where she handles an electro-ticked, space-age update of Paul McCartney’s middle eight (and really does sound like she just woke up, fell out of bed, and dragged a comb across her head). Curiously, the relatively reverential reading of the latter song leaves out its most notorious feature—that dramatic, sustained piano-pounded finale. The omission is both intentionally heretical (how can you end that song any other way?) yet oddly reverential, suggesting that, even if you’re subjecting one of the most revered albums of all time to sadistic sonic surgery, some things are sacred. According to the eternally loopy logic of the Flaming Lips, reinforcing a spiritual connection to your greatest influence means cutting the chord.\""

       "'Burn Your Fire for No Witness\\xa0finds the singer-songwriter inhabiting a fuller, louder sound and embracing punchier song structures. The blown-out, full-band energy enlivens Olsen, kindling an intensity that’s always been present in her songs and fanning the flames even higher. “Hi-Five”, the third song on Angel Olsen’s second album,\\xa0Burn Your Fire for No Witness, has got to be one of the most cheerful songs ever written about being lonely. A twangy electric folk tune that begins with an invocation of its muse, Hank Williams, the song is all stomp-and-rollick until it stops to catch its breath for a moment in the bridge. “Are you lonely too?” Olsen warbles. A beat later, her band’s back in full Technicolor, and the next line hits like a title card in an old “Batman” episode: “HI-FIVE!/ SO AM I!”Olsen’s voice is enchanting; it sounds like the result of a spell that called for Leonard Cohen’s blood, Buffy Sainte-Marie’s larynx, and a still-operational old-timey microphone emblazoned with radio call letters. Her songs are powered by a strange, anarchic electricity, always flickering on the edge of blowing out. By the laws of the unique universe she creates on her records, Wanting, Waiting, and (probably the most popular pastime in her songs) Thinking are not passive stances but active ways of being in the world; unruly emotion is a virtue. “You don’t sing so high and wild,” she sneers at one point to a detached lover, and in an Angel Olsen song this is an insult so harsh it’s almost obscene. This guy may as well be dead.Olsen first gained notice as the stand-out eccentric in Bonnie “Prince” Billy’s mysterious band the Babblers (given that all six of them were known to perform in hooded pajamas and sunglasses, this is saying something). In 2010, she released an arresting tape on\\xa0Bathetic called Strange Cacti, which gave off the impression that she’d recorded it after falling down a well, trying to sing loudly and cavernously and urgently enough to be found. And she was, more or less—her cult following multiplied with the release of 2012’s excellent Half Way Home, a surreal and lyrical collection of folk songs that sounded a bit like Vashti Bunyan playing a midnight game of Ouija. Most of the songs on Half Way Home were driven by Olsen’s hushed acoustic guitar, so her 2013 single “Sweet Dreams” was a thrilling left turn—a swirling, psych-pop reverie. To overpower the percussion and charred electric guitars, she sang even wilder.Burn Your Fire for No Witness picks up where “Sweet Dreams” left off, blossoming into a fuller, louder sound and embracing punchier song structures. It’s not as weird or raw a record as Half Way Home, but producer John Congleton manages to sand the rough edges off Olsen’s music without quite taming it. She and her band (Joshua Jaeger on drums and Stewart Bronaugh on bass and guitar) talk to each other effortlessly: On the great lead-off single “Fogiven/Forgotten”, the kick drum accents her open-hearted declarations like expertly placed exclamation points (“I don’t know anything!/ But I love you!”), and as the energy of “Lights Out” mounts, she passes the baton to Bronaugh for a perfectly timed solo. The blown-out, full-band energy enlivens Olsen, kindling an intensity that’s always been present in her songs and fanning the flames even higher. On repeated listens, subtler highlights emerge. \"Enemy\" hangs like a spiderweb in the album\\'s quietest corridor—an intricate wisp of a song that she patiently spins into something hallowed and heartbreaking. Then there’s “White Fire”, a sparse, nearly seven-minute incantation that sounds like a lost Songs of Leonard Cohen cut but gradually accumulates an atmosphere of its own. When Olsen switches into ballad mode, she fares best with hushed, minimal arrangements. The echoing percussion and shimmering chords of “Dance Slow Decades” cloak the song in a relatively ill-fitting grandeur; the demo is probably more of a gut-punch. Same goes for the indistinct closer “Window”, which sounds a bit too much like someone trying to write a Feist song. Still, that last one feels like such an anomaly that it only underscores how distinct Olsen’s songwriting is across the rest of the record. Burn Your Fire for No Witness conjures the past without ever imitating it, swirling its influences into something intimate, impressionistic and new.“I wish it were the same as it is in my mind,” Olsen laments in “Enemy”; this is pretty much the central conflict in every Angel Olsen song. The people she writes about daydream vividly, mumble reassuring mantras to themselves (\"Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind\"), and get so caught up in the songs stuck in their heads that they accidentally walk past their own houses. And yet, even as she longs for deep connections and hi-fives from strangers, Olsen knows too well that dreamers are usually loners. Not that she really minds. If she seems unafraid of—even superhumanly amped about—loneliness, it’s because her songs find an almost beatific peace in solitude. “If you can’t be psyched about your own thoughts,” she said in an interview a few years ago, “Then how are you supposed to have a meaningful interaction with anyone?” It’s a point she’s carried over into her music, honed in seclusion but now ready for more people to bear witness to its peculiar charms.'"

       "'Born in the Echoes continues the creative resurgence ignited by the Chemical Brothers\\' brilliant last full-length, 2010’s Further. In contrast to that album\\'s loved-up euphoria, Echoes is a grab bag: Festival fillers and club bangers rub up against wondrously bizarre studio experiments and some of the best pure pop songs Rowlands and Simons have ever made. \"The future? I’ll see you there!\" These words come in the middle of the latest album from London dance music survivors the Chemical Brothers. It could be a sly nod to their influence on this decade’s global electronic boom. Back in the mid-1990s, acts like the Chems, Fatboy Slim, and the Prodigy were primed to vanquish guitar rock once and for all while ushering in a squelching age of rave. It didn’t work out that way and, soon enough, Limp Bizkit were dragging their knuckles all the way to the top of the charts. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons’ radical mix of acid house, hip-hop, and shaggy psych was deemed just another pop fad. But now, with EDM festivals drawing millions of fans around the world and spiritual big beat descendants like Diplo and Hudson Mohawke helping to shape the Hot 100, it’s clear that the Chemical Brothers were both ambassadors and soothsayers. And they’re still around. They deserve to gloat.Then again, the line could also suggest something more sinister. It’s taken from a spoken-word performance by iconoclastic 76-year-old Canadian poet bill bissett, whose idea of \"the future\" involves scentless flowers, two-headed babies, and other marks of a hellish apocalypse; for every hit of ecstatic futurism, they seem to be saying, there is an equal and opposite dose of reality. Meanwhile, the music of \"I’ll See You There\" finds Rowlands and Simons once again tripping out on the past, as howled backmasking and frenzied drums criss-cross in an effort to once again capture the headiness of their own psychedelic pop ur-text, the Beatles’ \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". All of which leads us to the eternal present—the now—which happens to be a place that suits the Chemical Brothers quite well.Born in the Echoes is the pair’s eighth album and it continues the creative resurgence ignited by their brilliant last full-length, 2010’s Further, which served as something of a career reset following a decade of flagging potency. But whereas that album was marked by extended dancefloor workouts, seamless DJ-style transitions, and an overall feeling of loved-up euphoria, Echoes is more of a grab bag: Enormous festival fillers and hard-nosed club bangers rub up against wondrously bizarre studio experiments and some of the best pure pop songs Rowlands and Simons have ever made.Like fellow \\'90s innovators Daft Punk, the Chems have managed to last more than 20 years in part because they are smart enough to prioritize mindless immediacy. The two upper middle class boys bonded while studying history at Manchester University at the height of the city’s ecstasy heyday; they would read Chaucer’s bawdy Canterbury Tales and then head over to The Haçienda and flail about with 1,000 of their new best friends. They quoted British novelist Evelyn Waugh on an early EP title and then sampled roughneck New York rapper Keith Murray on their ageless classic Dig Your Own Hole. Simons recently returned to the world of academia (and will miss this year’s Chemical Brothers tour dates because of it), while Rowlands recently summed up the duo’s objectives thusly: \"We\\'re just really into making funny sounds and putting them into some kind of order that makes sense … Not every song has to be the meaning of life.\" So on Echoes we get Q-Tip spouting motivational pizza box rhymes over rubberband basslines on future sports montage soundtrack \"Go\" followed by St. Vincent staring into the suicidal void of a performer’s high on \"Under Neon Lights\", which peaks with a guitar (or is it a synth?) solo that searingly recalls \"Bulls on Parade\". We get the viscous funk of \"Taste of Honey\"—replete with buzzing bee cameo—next to the taut title track, which features a coolly distant vocal from Cate Le Bon and sounds like a worthy tribute to the late, great psych auteurs Broadcast. Then Beck shows up at the end to help Rowlands and Simons create the finest New Order song in ages. \"Wide Open\" makes the inevitability of losing it—life, love, inspiration—sound terribly triumphant, and just as the track hits its climax, Beck wisely gets out of the way, making room for undulating waveforms that bristle and burst with all-too-human imperfections.Talking to Spin about his Big Beat contemporaries in 1999, Ed Simons suggested, \"There’s surely going to come a time when those kind of tricks—all the drops and builds and rhythm changes—aren’t going to trigger the same responses in people.\" Of course, the same could be said of today’s insta-nuke dance tracks, the ones that try to cheat death by just running away from it really fast and really hard. And, to be fair, the Chemical Brothers have deployed plenty of drops and builds and rhythm changes across the last two decades. But Rowlands and Simons’ version of the future isn’t one of narrow-minded annihilation; there are levels to it, along with paths that connect everything from the Fab Four to \"Funky Drummer\" to Phuture. Part of a fast-moving culture always looking for the next high, the Chemical Brothers remain steadfast—eyeing the past and future while living in the here and now.'"

You suspect that when Brian Eno co-founded the Long Now Foundation in 1996, he was confident in there actually being a future for the planet – its art projects included a clock in a mountain designed to tick for 10,000 years, as an exercise in stretching our perception of time.

It’s as huge and enveloping as you’d hope, its undulating soundscapes suffused with longing and wonder. But there is a mournful quality, too, something heartbreakingly elegiac about these songs. There Were Bells was composed for an event at the Acropolis in Athens last year, performed on a sweltering 45-degree day; as Eno recalls: “I thought, here we are at the birthplace of modern civilisation, probably witnessing the end of it.” Notably, these are songs rather than ambient pieces, and Eno’s voice is deeper now and more commanding, even as it ripples with anger, regret – flashing like a chameleon’s skin in flux. The gorgeous single We Let It In, which features vocals from daughter Darla, is a meditative jewel. It’s stirring to hear Eno sing again – these songs feel personal, intimate and urgent. '"

The poor woman has been stuck with the Voice of a Generation tag, a surefire way of lumbering an artist with expectations anyone would struggle live up to: “a term that can create problems for anybody,” as Bob Dylan – who should know – once put it. Still, you can see how it’s ended up appended to Parks’ name with such regularity and despite her protestations. She calls herself an empath – someone deeply attuned to other people’s feelings – and has been lauded for writing about “sexual identity, queer desire, mental health, body image”, according to one profile. You read a lot of fans “speaking their pain” in the comments section below her YouTube videos. The problem is that it makes Parks sound painfully worthy, part of that recent eat-your-greens strain of pop that comes with a sense of earnest moral obligation attached: music that’s sold to you on the basis of what it stands for rather than how it sounds. And that would be a desperately unfair interpretation of Collapsed in Sunbeams, an album that needs no special pleading. Lyrics are clearly Parks’ thing – so much so that she opens the album with a burst of spoken-word poetry. But as you listen, you realise she could be singing almost anything, and Collapsed in Sunbeams would still work. She has a lovely voice: airy, natural and unshowy, with a London-accented conversational tone that occasionally recalls a less flippant Lily Allen. Her writing with collaborator Gianluca Buccellati has an unhurried melodic fluency – Green Eyes and Eugene drift charmingly along – and they’ve hit on a sound that works: commercial without submitting to current pop cliches or blandness. There are crisp, looped breakbeats and subtle shadings of vintage soul, as when an organ rises gently into the mix on Too Good. Reverb-heavy electric guitar ranges from funk riffs to icy, Radiohead-esque figures to the heaving shoegazey textures of Caroline and crackly samples that betray her love of Portishead’s Dummy. Stripped of its vocals, the bass-heavy For Violet might have slotted neatly on to Mo’ Wax’s mid-90s trip-hop compilation Headz. The lyrics, meanwhile, tackle distinctly 21st-century anxieties. An lot of pop in recent years has attempted to deal with body image, mental-health issues or problems with sexual identity; so much so that you don’t have to be a terrible cynic to make out the sound of boxes being ticked. That isn’t the case here: Parks writes with a diaristic tone that suggests lived experience rather than a self-conscious desire to tackle the burning issues of the day. She has a great turn of phrase – “wearing suffering like a spot of bling”; “the air was fragrant and heavy with our silence”, “shards of glass live in this feeling” – and a desire to be, as she puts it, “both universal and hyper-specific”. If you were minded to nitpick, you might suggest that she’s rather better at the latter than the former, that the broad brushstrokes lean a little on self-help platitudes of the “you gotta trust how you feel inside” variety. Her real skill lies in observing small, telling details: the depressed friend whose overload of makeup leaves her looking “like Robert Smith”; the “artsy couple” she watches arguing in the street on Caroline, “strawberry cheeks flushed with defeated rage”; or in the sudden switch to a blunt, colloquial tone. “You know when college starts again you’ll manage,” she counsels a friend struggling to live at home on For Violet. “I wish your parents had been kinder to you,” she tells an ex whose struggle with her sexuality scuppers their relationship. But then, why would you be minded to nitpick with a debut this good? It appears to announce the arrival of a major new talent, though you never know: the path of an artist stuck with the Voice of a Generation tag is fraught with pitfalls. You can succumb to self-importance, you can discover your skills lay in describing a specific moment in time and struggle to move on. But that’s the future, something that currently feels more imponderable than ever. Right now, Collapsed in Sunbeams feels like a warm breeze in the depths of a miserable winter.

As tracklists go, you don’t get much more evocative than the one attached to Tegan and Sara’s ninth album, a series of furiously indignant, laughably melodramatic and stomach-churningly poignant missives from the standard-issue internal monologue of the unhappy teenager. It’s tempting to leave the likes of Hold My Breath Until I Die and Don’t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie) as song titles alone, imagining the contents to fit your own heady nostalgia trip. But if you do decide to dive in, you’ll discover plenty more painfully perfect evocations of adolescent angst inside. Hey, I’m Just Like You is not merely an exercise in remembrance, however. In a pleasingly poetic act of artistic time travel, the 39-year-old Quin twins actually co-created the album with their teenage selves. The 12 tracks included here are tweaked versions of songs they wrote between the ages of 15 and 17, discovered on cassette while excavating material for their new memoir, High School. Perhaps because of the tinkering, the record doesn’t quite have the mortifying novelty value of actual juvenilia, and those familiar with Tegan and Sara’s artistic trajectory might detect a whiff of anachronism about the way these songs have been realised. The duo started life as an indie-rock outfit, pivoting to pop in the early 2010s with their album Heartthrob – Hey, I’m Just Like You feels of a piece with their more recent work. Although there are traces of the sisters’ early infatuation with bands such as Green Day (especially on the chugging I’ll Be Back Someday), the defining sound is slick, pulsing and often pretty saccharine. There are some pleasing interludes, particularly the doomy drop on Don’t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie), but it’s not always a style that proves hugely diverting, being a sort of beta-pop that falls into the cracks between instantly memorable, innovative and entertainingly extravagant.

There’s a sturdy quality to the neat, cute repetitions in his guitar backings, the bamboo that the bindweed of his voice trails around, and while the drums still tread the same happy trudge, he adds some well-chosen new flavours. There’s mellifluous crooning on Rollin With the Flow, country-soul backing vocals from Warpaint drummer Stella Mozgawa on the beautiful One Trick Ponies, a rather menacing electronic murk behind Check Baby, a bit of deep clarinet on the title track; Cold Was the Wind puts the bong in bongos. Best of all is his decision to let four songs wander up to, and sometimes over, the 10-minute mark – this amplifies the bean-baggy vibe, and lets Vile’s idling poetry really find its slacker voice. It also allows room, on Skinny Mini, for two great guitar solos, where jazzy improvisation turns into big fuzz chords, like a traditional solo deconstructed into separate notes. Lesser musicians would make these songs as boring as a drugs story you aren’t involved in, but Vile ultimately has such an instinctive facility for melodic logic that behind the shaggy locks and purple haze, there’s a clear-headed, big-hearted songwriter at work.'"

       "'\\n\\n\\n\\nMidway through Nothing Special, the own-name debut of Okkervil River frontperson Will Sheff, he asks a question that interrogates not only his role in the world, but the fact that he has the role he’s been given in the first place: “How come someone as soft as me should have to set the bent world straight?” Since their inception, Okkervil River have been responsible for some of the most funny, introspective songwriting in the increasingly-nebulous “indie-folk-rock” sphere, capable of writing a pithy one-liner or a heartbreaking stanza that felt capable of rewiring your brain’s neural pathways while leaving you reeling from having one of his songs stuck in your head for a week. But Sheff is no dummy; he knows that he has this power, like many singer-songwriters before him (and alongside him) — though the rest of us mere mortals may not be able to relate, it totally tracks that someone might ask themselves, “Why must it be me?”\\nIn this way, Nothing Special feels like Sheff’s attempt at hitting the reset button on the myth of Okkervil River, and thereby unburdening himself from the pressures that come from making an album under that name. Though Sheff’s songwriting keeps us firmly tethered to the music he made before it, at times he feels like the only distinct constant. These songs are straightforward, non-experimental, and even at their absolute best, they really aren’t ever catchy. In the four years since In the Rainbow Rain, Sheff seems to have distilled everything that matters to him as a singer-songwriter, and Nothing Special is his way of bottling that tincture.\\nThe biggest problem is that, in doing that, it feels like Sheff may have lost sight of some of the most charming elements that really helped make Okkervil River albums not just great, but engaging. In a field full of outstanding, introspective songwriters, an album like Black Sheep Boy, which paired that songwriting with idiosyncratic yawping and excellently-layered rock songs that didn’t feel quite like anything being made within their field. But Nothing Special doesn’t have its own “For Real,” or “Unless It’s Kicks” or “Lost Coastlines” — which is to say, nothing really stands out. Arguably, you could say the album is, perhaps, nothing special? (That’s a joke. We just had to get it out of the way.)\\nIn all seriousness, none of this is to say Nothing Special doesn’t possess greatness. Sheff is incapable of writing bad songs at this point in his career, and these eight songs should be highlights in an already illustrious career. The record shows that Sheff has lost none of his songwriting prowess, which is clear from the jump. On opener “The Spiral Season,” he lets the stanza “Years pass, I’m friends with my flaws/ Glimpsing the earth through a God/ Burnished by beautiful laws/ No wiser now than I was” tumble out of him like it wasn’t expertly crafted as though chiseled out of a block of marble. That’s how many songs and moments within Nothing Special feel, from the dull ache imbued in the album’s title-track (which serves as Sheff’s way of eulogizing former Okkervil drummer Travis Nelsen, who passed away in early 2020, as well as providing him a way of grieving the years-long estrangement that preceded his death) to the well-worn warmth of “Like the Last Time,” which gives us a rug-pull moment at the two-minute mark that feels somewhat out of place for the album, but helps elevate it to something more than “nothing special” by its inclusion. The truest standout, though, is the sprawling, eight-and-a-half minute “Holy Man,” where Sheff drives home his role as a salve for the pain of the masses: “I take the world’s full weight on my tongue,” he sings solemnly, as if coming to truly accept the questioning he did on “Estrangement Zone.” \\nWhether or not Okkervil River are dead as in “never going to release another album” or dead as in “named a song ‘Okkervil River R.I.P.’ and then still made more Okkervil River records,” this will likely be a question that plagues just about every review of Nothing Special. This is the curse of the frontperson, doomed to be forever compared to the work that came before, no matter the name on the cover. Because of this, it’s hard to look clearly at Nothing Special, which might be a staggering debut by another artist, but at this point feels like going back to square one for someone who has been so fully-formed for so many years. All of the former brilliance of Sheff’s music will undoubtedly return with future releases, regardless of the name on the cover — but for now, we can chalk the good-but-not-greatness here up to the jitters of starting a new, more vulnerable journey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt’s hard to look clearly at Nothing Special, which might be a staggering debut by another artist, but at this point feels like going back to square one for someone who has been so fully-formed for so many years.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n69 %\\n\\nPerfectly Titled\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Dwyer’s Osees (under any name) derive much of their power from their kinetic experimentation. Given, arguably, a garage rock foundation, the group has succeeded with odd forays into psychedelia, pop, metal, prog and more. After last year’s ambitious Protean Threat, Dwyer decided there was some terrain he hadn’t covered in the act’s first 20 or so albums, so Osees came back quickly with Panther Rotate. The new album puts a twist on its predecessor, using those studio tracks for a series of remixes while blending in field recordings and other aural experiments. The finished record, a sort of sequel, sounds a little like fiddling. Fans will likely enjoy Dwyer express new sides to his art, but the album too often lacks the excitement of the group’s best work.\\nOne way into the album would be to simply study the transformations the music underwent between releases. A cut like “If I Had an Experiment” offers some clear direction for this approach, with the changed use of the guitar hits making for a new song that’s engaging on its own while being a reminder of its predecessor (“If I Had My Way”). “Miz Experiment” similarly enables direct comparison, but its steady, synth roll pales next to the heavier, more surprising “Mizmuth.” Dwyer might be having fun reworking his music, but in reimagining it, he’s not improving (which wouldn’t be the point anyway).\\nRegardless of the studious pleasures of hopping back and forth between records, listening to Panther Rotate probably makes most sense when it’s considered as a standalone piece. On its own terms, the album blends a diverse set of studio technique. Dwyer pokes at the fringes of rock. His play with textures and effects works best when he either builds on or dismantles a core sound. “Scramble Experiment” situates itself in Krautrock, but Dwyer’s flourishes make the cut something a bit out of line with its forerunners, as it should be. “Toadstool Experiment” wanders; it suggests that Osees could make some intriguing glitch-pop before heading into a muddier plod. \\nWhen Dwyer works to find new entry points or deconstructions, he reminds us of how exciting and inventive his work can be. Too often, though, his restructurings largely work to half-reveal sonic elements at the cost of musical energy. Turning “Gong of Catastrophe” into the haunted “Gong Experiment” makes sense and fills a gap in the band’s voluminous work. That track offers much more intrigue than “Toadstool” or “Miz.” The new material, like “Synthesis” and “Poem 2 with Horns” provide their own rewards, but the slow pacing of both cuts (particularly the former, which never quite decides what sort of music it means to be) risks more drag in the album. Panther Rotate, more than would be expected from the group, requires focused listening to find detail-oriented rewards. It mostly succeeds at fulfilling that offer, but it doesn’t quite keep it up for the whole record. It’s hard to call it a misstep, though, as it serves its purpose in pushing Osees into new places, allowing new insights to come from an unusually prolific act that, remarkably, hasn’t run out of things to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen John Dwyer works to find new entry points or deconstructions, he reminds us of how exciting and inventive his work can be. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n62 %\\n\\nFans-Only Experimentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'\\nIt’s a combination that may strike listeners as a bit odd: Mike Patton’s avant garde vocal stylings often border on the completely unhinged, and Jean-Claude Vannier is the godfather of French pop music courtesy of his work with the lecherous Serge Gainsbourg. Having met at an event honoring Gainsbourg, their subsequent pairing begins to make more and more sense, Patton having long been a collaborative spirit and vocal chameleon and Vannier providing instrumental backing for a who’s-who of French pop’s biggest, most influential names of the second half of the 20th century. The resulting collaboration, Corpse Flower, might not be a Histoire de Melody Nelson for the 21st century, but given Patton’s resume, the album’s far darker tone should come as no surprise. \\nOpening track “Ballade C.3.3” finds Patton reciting fragments of Oscar Wilde’s “The Ballad of Reading Gaol” over an appropriately sparse bit of percussion and bluesy instrumentation. It’s a simmering slow-burn bit of late-night poetry reading that helps establish early the ensuing aesthetic employed by the bulk of the album. As the name suggests, Corpse Flower is obsessed with all facets of life and death, heavy on the latter and as darkly as the cover image. It’s a difficult listen, and a bleak one. \\n“Chanson d’amour” is the most immediately indebted to the Gainsbourg/Vannier aesthetic established on albums such as Histoire de Melody Nelson, though here sounding as though the former’s trademark sleazy croon were cribbed from a low rent Tom Waits. It’s a smoky, bluesy bit of late night cabaret – heavy on the piano – filtered through the grime and haze of Patton’s patented avant garde approach to nearly every project of which he’s been a part since the formation of Mr. Bungle in the ‘80s. His raspy croon comes out of the speakers like a Gainsbourgian ghost, floating in on a haze of cigarette smoke, intoning the title phrase in a passable French accent before going full Waits-circa-Nighthawks at the Diner.\\nNot surprisingly, much of Corpse Flower hinges on Patton’s speak-singing and a borderline Waitsian growl designed to cultivate a very specific aesthetic, one heavily aged in darkened barrooms after hours, surrounded by all manner of questionable humanity. It’s an often unsettling listen that plays like an even more fucked up late-period Scott Walker (RIP) taking his blackened approach to a new series of extremes. “Cold Sun, Warm Beer” is a prime, pessimism-infused example of this, made all the more warped by Vannier’s deceptively complex arrangement. \\nPatton has long shown himself to be an incredibly versatile and creative vocalist in a variety of settings, but here he keeps his multitudinous approaches largely in check in favor of the speak-sing-growl. He hints at a more nuanced vocal approach on tracks like the note-perfect noir of “Browning” and the eerie-in-the-best-way “Hungry Ghost,” there occasionally sounding, unintentionally, no doubt, like an outtake from Andrew Lloyd Weber’s Phantom of the Opera.\\nThe title track is a short, comparatively jaunty minor key bit of cabaret jazz featuring Patton spouting all manner of multi-lingual gibberish in a menacing, phlegmatic growl. It’s also one of the best showcases for Vannier’s compositional approach, cramming a variety of sounds and styles together to create something at once familiar and utterly foreign. Similarly, “Insolubles” plays with a more organic approach with its Eastern instrumentation and modalities, each juxtaposed against Patton’s Paolo Conte-esque vocal style. This is one of a series of extremely continental sounding arrangements scattered throughout Corpse Flower, making for a decidedly trans-Atlantic listen. \\nCorpse Flower is an adventurous, enjoyable listen, the result of an iconoclastic pairing of two artists willing to push the envelope in myriad ways in order to come up with something both unique and familiar in its Frankensteining of the two primary artists’ storied careers. Look no further than “On Top of the World” for evidence, as an otherwise pleasant bit of chamber music is cut by Patton howling over Vannier’s heavy, dirty blues: “If I get to the top of the world/ I’ll take a shit right now on this Earth.” \\n\\n'"

       "'\\nTwenty-five studio albums into its career, Uriah Heep proves that its glory days aren’t a thing of the past. There have been uneasy passages in the hard rock outfit’s nearly 50-year career, but in recent years guitarist Mick Box (the sole holdover from the so-called classic era) has led the group through a series of ace records that restore our faith in the Heep as a group that never gives less than its best. \\nCut from a cloth that’s not dissimilar from Deep Purple with crunchy keyboard passages (handled here by Phil Lazon, a member since 1985) and wailing guitar lines nestled between billowing bits of bruised blues from vocalist Bernie Shaw—Living the Dream—is proof that familiar music tropes don’t have to be cliché. \\n“Grazed By Heaven,” which kicks off this platter, has all the guts and glory one would expect from a collective trekking to the studio for the first time. There’s a hunger to the rhythms and lyrical passages that could strike fear into the hearts of lesser rockers. That can sound like blissful hyperbole but there’s a lingering sense that Box is poised to prove his band can retain its rank among the world’s best even if it’s now approaching the late stages of its career. \\nWitness the titular piece, in which the quintet (rounded out by drummer Russel Gilbrook and bassist Davey Rimmer) lays waste to its gear with a ferocity that Heep had not yet reached on classic albums such as Look at Yourself or Demons and Wizards. There is something to be said for experience and wisdom and perhaps nowhere is that as evident in the Heep oeuvre as here. \\nThis is a group that arrived in the same batch as progressive heavyweights Yes and the boogie-down stylings of Wishbone Ash and those genetic elements rise up during pieces such as the eight-minute “Rocks in The Road.” If full-on prog was never what Box and the band excelled at, they still managed to show a deep affinity for its unexpected twists and turns while keeping the fantasy references tastefully in check. Imagine progressive rock as imagined not by kids who’d sung in the Anglican choir or studied at the Royal Academy but by blokes who’d crawled from the alleyways of Birmingham and into the rock ‘n’ roll limelight. \\nOf course, Heep originated in the more urbane and storied London, but it was never afraid to be grittier than its counterparts, something that becomes apparent throughout numbers such as “Waters Flowing” and “Knocking at My Door.” There are some more predictable moments, ones that are more workaday than technicolor, including “It’s All Been Said” and “Goodbye to Innocence” but even there one can find reason to celebrate the sheer loudness and unrepentant glee heard in a band that’s weathered myriad storms in its long run. \\nThere’s little chance that this will find an audience with metal heads brought up in the wake of Slipknot and Korn but perhaps it will trickle into the imaginations of elder rockers who crave a brand of music filled with a temperance of anger and soul. And if this is someone’s first bout with Uriah Heep, here’s hoping they work backward and find the many highs and lows spread across a career most groups can only dream of having. \\n\\n'"

       "'\\nWhen Tyondai Braxton parted ways with experimental art rock outfit Battles in 2010, he did so because of a desire to focus on his solo work. It comes as some surprise, then, that Braxton’s first solo release since the breakup didn’t drop for five years. Battles managed to regroup and pump out Gloss Drop in 2011, which may not have reached the heights of 2007’s hugely acclaimed Mirrored, but it did manage to successfully redefine the band. Despite a gap in studio work, Braxton has been busy as a composer and in the past half-decade his stock has only risen within high art circles. His compositions have been performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Kronos Quartet and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Much of this was focused on his 2009 Stravinsky-influenced Central Market. A dramatic tonal shift from that endeavor, HIVE1 also debuted in the art house, premiering as part of a multimedia art installation at New York’s Guggenheim Museum.\\nAs part of a multimedia art installation, HIVE1 is fascinating. There have been headlines about sophisticated computers making their own trippy visual art and HIVE1 sounds like what a computer would musically conjure up if left to its own devices. That’s both a testament to the complexity of Braxton’s abstract compositions and a statement on how inaccessible and even alienating HIVE1 will be to most listeners.\\nThe album title, HIVE1, reflects the art installation’s inclusion of many artists, collaborating in synchronous tandem. The album title also conveys the way its amelodic tracks sound as though they’re thrumming with computerized insects. This is a dramatic about-face from the symphonic aspirations of Central Market and a return to Braxton’s electronic early days that stretch back into the late ’90s, predating Battles. While his aversion to touring was part of the reason for the split with that band, he won’t have to worry about a supporting tour for HIVE1. The music on this abstract album is better suited for headphones—or even an emergence from a sensory-deprivation tank mind-trip— than a club full of tipsy bodies.\\nUnsurprisingly, it’s the longer tracks on HIVE1 that are the most successful. They’re able to stretch out and establish various movements. “Boids” opens with a ping-ponging rattle that gives way to electronic shimmers and loping electro-beats, allowing it weave into a diverse tapestry of sound that’s pleasant while also harboring a hint of the ominous. And the album closer, “Scout 1,” which plays for nearly 10 minutes, may be the record’s highlight. It explores tribal and cosmic percussion, sounding both primal and transcendent as it morphs through its many progressions. And the seven minute-plus “Amlochley” comes off as the album at its most insectile, as it chirps and skitters and hums its way through unique percussion. It’s the song most reminiscent of Battles on the entire album.\\nThe shorter tracks threaten to grate on the listener. “Phono Pastoral” mercifully cuts out after less than two minutes. Its abrasive electronic noodling sounds like twisting knobs and buttons being pushed at random. The tinkling chime effects of three-minute opener “Gracka” never gel into anything approaching melody, and the clapping percussion and throbbing low-end make for layers that don’t fit.\\nThough he left the munchkin vocals of Mirrored behind, Braxton continues to push experimental music boundaries. Without the full multimedia art experience, HIVE1 challenges with its abstraction but does little to reward its listener’s patience. Though it may be artistic, HIVE1 is a challenge without much payoff.\\n\\n'"

       "'\\n[xrr rating=3.0/5]It’s hard enough to be the drummer. The blue-collar of the band, always in the background locked down to a stool, often overlooked, if visible at all. But when you’re a drummer and just ahead of the release of your second solo record (following-up a timid first effort) your enigmatic frontman goes and surprises the world and unleashes a media event for his own proper release, the knife seems to twist a little bit more. Though Philip Selway will never be confused for Thom Yorke and likely has no interest in switching places with him, with Weatherhouse, he’s making it a bit harder to go unnoticed.\\nTo be clear, Selway isn’t just a drummer. Manning the kit for Radiohead, he’s responsible for both some of the grooviest and the most offbeat time signatures of the past 20 years, not to mention his harmony additions. Thus the disappointment many felt by Familial, his folky 2010 release that was so delicate, it very much suited the role of someone not wanting any sort of spotlight on them. Weatherhouse, however, finds Selway seemingly more confident, playing with more mechanical undertones and an almost hymn-like approach much more in line with his day job than its predecessor. It’s a heavier record in every sense, and it has much more of a group feel despite having fewer players (he’s joined by multi-instrumentalists Quinta and Adem Ilhan).\\nThough not always consistent, Weatherhouse’s strength is in its varied dynamics, something glaringly absent on Familial but evident in the first few moments here. In fact, listen to the beginning of the album-opening “Coming Up For Air” and you might think you’re listening to The King of Limbs. “I feel a lot in the air has changed/ I’m not alone,” Selway sings, as strong, pulsating electronics, serpentine undertones and a steady beat give way to a flower-y chorus shimmering with U2 guitars. Built around a rubbery groove that wouldn’t have been out of place on Hail to the Thief, “Around Again” features the most interesting percussion of his solo releases, while “Miles Away” displays the kind of Aphex Twin atmoshperics that could easily be pictured to be sung by Yorke. It’s the opening of “Ghosts” that bares the most striking resemblance to Radiohead, however. With angular acoustic guitars and a melody that directly recalls “Exit Music (For A Film),” you’ll do a double take before the tracks veers into the dark, breezy territory of South.\\nWhen Weatherhouse falls flat, it has nothing to do with the actual songs. Selway’s voice is crystal clear and he has a soft and melodic delivery, but it often lacks bite and can come across very anonymous. The Beatles-esque piano ballad “It Will End in Tears” is a nice track with the uncanny grandeur of Elbow, but it could have benefitted from more of a weathered transmission. Similarly, the vibraphone and string combination of “Drawn to the Light” make for an interesting texture, but it essentially turns into background music outside of the instrumentation. Still, Selway is miles ahead of where he was, evidenced by far more compelling forays back to folk on tracks like “Don’t Go Now,” which features gorgeous strings atop plucked guitar that would have been dispatched in a much more reserved manner a few years ago.\\n“There’s always a sad song playing/ I’m over it now,” Selway sings during “Let It Go,” a track that seems to be about freeing oneself of pressure, of the past. Perhaps he’s talking about Radiohead, likely not, but it’s an interesting line given the record he’s made and how during that track moody piano passages toe the line against exhaling keyboards. Philip Selway certainly isn’t known to be a dark soul, but adding some shadow most definitely suits his music. Perhaps with Weatherhouse we’re getting to know the real Philip Selway.\\n\\n'"

Born Stephen Wilkinson, the multi-instrumentalist has practiced in everything from frail, back-country soundscapes (fi) to polysynth indie-thumpers (Mind Bokeh). Even with this eclectic catalog, Wilkinson’s nine-year career had produced a number of tracks that had yet been made available for public consumption; hence, the artistic urge to release The Green EP. A companion disc to last year’s Silver Wilkinson, the EP’s five previously unreleased tracks all share the same dream-folk meanderings of that LP’s “Dye The Water Green” single – which leads this new thematic collection.\\nAkin to fi, his debut LP, The Green is established on a feeble core of distorted acoustic guitar and Wilkinson’s depressed utterances. Lacking any true percussive elements, the tracks move like a lingering springtime raincloud. That sense of front porch relaxation echoes through the layered strings within “Dinghy” and the sounds of thunder can be heard amid the enchanting lo-fi crackle of “Down to the Sound”.\\nWhile the album’s shorter tracks (those mentioned above) lack the needed instrumental depth to make it onto a dedicated Bibio full-length, the EP’s longer efforts (“A Thousand Syllables” and “The Spiney View of Hinkley Point”) listen like commissioned scores that were subsequently abandoned. The former a hackneyed collage of extended organ tones, psyche-rock wordplay and lost electric guitar. The latter, a tribal post-rock foray into the dank depths of UK’s Mortimer Forest. Without the context of a larger body of work, both offer small dramatic glimpses into what might have been possible had Bibio kept pursuing that idea.\\nAs stand-along singles, “The Spiney View of Hinkley Point,” “Down To The Sound” and the lurking ambiance of “Carbon Wulf” are suitable additions to the Bibio catalog. The others were deservedly still locked away on a personal hard drive.\\n\\n'"

Turning “Gong of Catastrophe” into the haunted “Gong Experiment” makes sense and fills a gap in the band’s voluminous work. That track offers much more intrigue than “Toadstool” or “Miz.” The new material, like “Synthesis” and “Poem 2 with Horns” provide their own rewards, but the slow pacing of both cuts (particularly the former, which never quite decides what sort of music it means to be) risks more drag in the album. Panther Rotate, more than would be expected from the group, requires focused listening to find detail-oriented rewards. It mostly succeeds at fulfilling that offer, but it doesn’t quite keep it up for the whole record.

       "\"existential meditations and a groundwork for hope The experimental master's 29th solo studio album doesn't offer any solutions to humanity's existential threats, but it does offer hope for the future By Patrick Clarke 12th October 2022 \\n\\nBrian Eno CREDIT: Cecily Eno Among many other things, Brian Eno has always understood that good ambient and minimalist music is far, far more than the bland soundscapes. Having spearheaded the genre for half a century, he knows that at its best, it’s music that can touch a listener’s emotional core more powerfully than the most brutal heavy metal.\\nFor his 29th solo studio album ‘FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE’, he’s homing in on that fact. In a short essay that accompanies it, Eno writes about how he’s only recently begun to embrace “the idea that we artists are actually feelings-merchants”. At a time in which the fabric of reality seems to be coming untethered, he argues, perhaps if we can change the way we feel about the world, we might be able to save it.\\nThis album is a clear and direct response to the tumultuous world in which it was made, consumed with existentialist musings on climate change and the future of the human race – it is his first album with vocals for almost two decades. On ‘Icarus Or Bleriot’, Eno wonders whether we will end up like the former (the tragic Greek hero who flew too close to the sun and fell to his death) or the latter (the pioneering aviator who was the first to fly a plane across the English channel).\\nAdvertisement The record is reflective rather than a political manifesto. Eno’s conversations on the record are, essentially, with himself. The second track, ‘We Let It In’, is literally a breathing exercise, samples of human exhalations given cosmic weight by Eno’s glacially building synths. Frequently the music on ‘FOREVERANDEVERMORE’ is very beautiful, a complex and blanketing layers of sound.\\n\\nThat said, it’s not a record that ever quite allows you to settle. On the opener ‘Who Gives A Thought’, for instance, Eno meanders his way through questions of why we don’t care for microscopic worms just because they have no commercial value. Beneath the wash of synths behind him, there are buried churns, whizzes and loops that fire off in all directions. At times the record’s outright apocalyptic, like on ‘Garden Of Stars’, where his voice is stretched out into a sinister Gregorian chant, and the music starts to crackle, spit and fray as he repeats visions of doom: “These million years will end / They end in me.”\\n‘FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE’ is never quite an album that is completely comforting or despairing. Instead, it explores the vast reaches between the two and uses introspection as a means of finding stability in the chaos. It offers no conclusions or solutions for humanity’s vast existential threats, but it does set a groundwork from which we might make a start in tackling them.\\nDetails\\n\\n\\nRelease date: October 14, 2022\\nRecord label: Opal Music Ltd.\\n\\n Related TopicsBrian Eno   Search ReviewsAlbum Reviews Brian Eno – ‘FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE’ review: existential meditations and a groundwork for hope The experimental master's 29th solo studio album doesn't offer any solutions to humanity's existential threats, but it does offer hope for the future By Patrick Clarke 12th October 2022 \\n\\nBrian Eno CREDIT: Cecily Eno Among many other things, Brian Eno has always understood that good ambient and minimalist music is far, far more than the bland soundscapes.

       "'soothing sounds and universal tales The breakout star has crafted a quietly subversive pop record that, for all its deceptive softness, challenges old perceptions of sexuality and mental health By Georgia Evans 26th January 2021 \\n\\nArlo Parks. CREDIT: Alex Kurun Arlo Parks’ rise feels very timely indeed. Her music is like a warm hug, a reassurance that everything is going to be OK when the world is dark and things seem out of control. True to form, her debut album is a sanctuary of compassionate lyricism and groove-along tunes.\\n\\nRead More:\\xa0On the cover – Arlo Parks: “I feel like I’m 10 and 100 at once”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile 2020 may have been a write-off for most, it certainly was a good year for the 20-year-old west Londoner. She released a stream of well-received singles, was named BBC Music Introducing Artist of the Year, appeared on the cover of NME and featured on a playlist by Michelle Obama. Most importantly however, she became an advocate for the mental health charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably), which sent a powerful message of unity to her young fanbase. Languid breakout single ‘Hurt’, which appears here, epitomises Parks’ music as a soothing balm: “I know you can’t let go of anything at the moment / Just know it would hurt so, won’t hurt so much forever.”\\n\\n\\nDespite the deceptively soothing nature of her sound – soft neo-soul, acoustic guitar, that honeyed voice – Parks is an artist challenging received wisdom about mental health, a champion of free expression of self. She broke through in 2018 with the dreamy ‘Cola’, a disarmingly intimate tale of infidelity through poetic lyrics (“I miss the way you dressed all punk / With the black and the studs and the ripped up gloves / Bet she loved your tough-guy front”), illustrating complex emotions through an accessible medium – and was duly catapulted to indie stardom.\\nWritten in the same bedroom where she recorded most of her demos, and utilising old diaries and notebooks, ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’ is made up of daydream musings over jazz-meets-pop instrumentals. The 12-song collection feels more refined than her previous EPs, with slicker production from her label Transgressive, whose signees include Foals, Loyle Carner and Marika Hackman, yet maintains the intimacy that grabbed so many at the start of her career.\\nAdvertisement The album is laced with references to artists who influenced her, from Sylvia Plath to Robert Smith (on the irresistible ‘Eugene’, she wryly notes, “[You] read him Sylvia Plath / I thought that that was our thing)”, and Parks has described the album as “a series of vignettes and intimate portraits surrounding my adolescence and the people that shaped it. It is rooted in storytelling and nostalgia – I want it to feel both universal and hyper-specific.”\\nThis is evident from the opening title track. A spoken-word piece that underpins the sentiment of the whole record, ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’ is a poignant reflection on finding beauty in pain, embracing emotional turbulence and speaking openly about your feelings. We are all learning to trust our bodies, making peace with our own distortions,” Parks recites over stripped-back guitars and gently flowing synths, “You shouldn’t be afraid to cry in front of me”.\\nParks has a singular talent for tapping into sadness and turning it into something uplifting. Last year, NME named ‘Black Dog’, a track about depression, 2020’s “most devastating song”; with lines such as “Sometimes it seems like you won’t survive this / And honestly it’s terrifying,” it’s a brilliantly and sometimes painfully honest song. Meanwhile, tracks the likes of ‘Eugene’, which is about being in love with your straight friend – Parks is openly bisexual – and ‘For Violet’, which explores familial disapproval, further explore universal coming-of-age struggles.\\nWhenever she touches upon difficult subjects, though, Parks provides a voice of empathy and wisdom. ‘Hope’ channels the likes of Blood Orange with layered harmonies and psychedelic guitar riffs, while she sings, “You’re not alone / Like you think you are / We all have scars / I know it’s hard / You’re not alone.” Further into the track, there’s a resurrection of her spoken-word delivery as she earnestly addresses the listener: “I cannot communicate the depth of the feeling / Truth is I’m still learning to be open about this.”\\nToo Good’ adds a greater feeling of lightness to counteract darker themes, bringing texture to the collection. Backed by bouncy guitars, funky basslines and catchy pop hooks, Parks sings an infectious chorus: “I think you know it / Too cool to show it / Babe, you’re so good / You’re too good to be true.” Then there’s the stunning ‘Green Eyes’, which was co-written with new-gen icon Clairo and sees the pair reflect on social attitudes towards same-sex relationships: “Some of these folks wanna make you cry / But you gotta trust how you feel inside and shine.”\\nThe closing track, ‘Portra 400’, rounds off this vivid portrait of young adulthood through delicate instrumentals and lines such as “Making rainbows, out of something painful / Getting fried as hell / And dodging gravestones.” This finale perfectly summarises the profound thought patterns interwoven throughout ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’.\\nAdvertisement \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArlo Parks: Meet the NME 1000 seconds of 1 minute, 13 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemSeek %0-9\\n \\n\\n\\n facebook twitter Email Linkhttps://cdn.jwplayer.com/previews/4CByxULkCopied Embed<iframe src=\"//content.jwplatform.com/players/4CByxULk-D03d95kJ.html\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\"></iframe>CopiedLive00:0001:1301:13More Videos26:55NIKI on ‘Every Summertime’, Coachella & being inspired by Halsey | In Conversation01:12Meet the stars of the NME 100 2018: Park Hotel02:22Talk Show: Meet the NME 10001:48Zuzu: Meet the NME 10002:07Do Nothing: Meet the NME 10001:58Benjiflow: Meet the NME 100Close\\xa0\\n\\nArlo Parks may be the voice of Gen Z, but there’s no doubt that this is a universal collection of stories that’ll provide solace for listeners of all ages and backgrounds for decades to come.\\nDetails\\n\\nRelease date:\\xa0January 29\\nRecord label: Beatnik,\\xa0Transgressive\\n \\nWhile 2020 may have been a write-off for most, it certainly was a good year for the 20-year-old west Londoner.

Backed by bouncy guitars, funky basslines and catchy pop hooks, Parks sings an infectious chorus: “I think you know it / Too cool to show it / Babe, you’re so good / You’re too good to be true.” Then there’s the stunning ‘Green Eyes’, which was co-written with new-gen icon Clairo and sees the pair reflect on social attitudes towards same-sex relationships: “Some of these folks wanna make you cry / But you gotta trust how you feel inside and shine.”\\nThe closing track, ‘Portra 400’, rounds off this vivid portrait of young adulthood through delicate instrumentals and lines such as “Making rainbows, out of something painful / Getting fried as hell / And dodging gravestones.” This finale perfectly summarises the profound thought patterns interwoven throughout ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’.\\nAdvertisement \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArlo Parks: Meet the NME 1000 seconds of 1 minute, 13 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemSeek %0-9\\n \\n\\n\\n facebook twitter Email Linkhttps://cdn.jwplayer.com/previews/4CByxULkCopied Embed<iframe src=\"//content.jwplatform.com/players/4CByxULk-D03d95kJ.html\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\"></iframe>CopiedLive00:0001:1301:13More Videos26:55NIKI on ‘Every Summertime’, Coachella & being inspired by Halsey | In Conversation01:12Meet the stars of the NME 100 2018: Park Hotel02:22Talk Show: Meet the NME 10001:48Zuzu: Meet the NME 10002:07Do Nothing: Meet the NME 10001:58Benjiflow: Meet the NME 100Close\\xa0\\n\\nArlo Parks may be the voice of Gen Z, but there’s no doubt that this is a universal collection of stories that’ll provide solace for listeners of all ages and backgrounds for decades to come.\\nDetails\\n\\nRelease date:\\xa0January 29\\nRecord label: Beatnik,\\xa0Transgressive\\n \\nWhile 2020 may have been a write-off for most, it certainly was a good year for the 20-year-old west Londoner.

Most importantly however, she became an advocate for the mental health charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably), which sent a powerful message of unity to her young fanbase. Languid breakout single ‘Hurt’, which appears here, epitomises Parks’ music as a soothing balm: “I know you can’t let go of anything at the moment / Just know it would hurt so, won’t hurt so much forever.”\\n Related TopicsArlo ParksPop'"

Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons’ peerless ‘Dig Your Own Hole’ introduced rock and psychedelia to dance music’s palette in 1997, and they pioneered combining indie vocalists with big beats on early records like scorching Noel Gallagher collaborations ‘Setting Sun’ (1997) and ‘Let Forever Be’ (1999).\\nBut for a while in the 2000s, they threatened to become one of the most predictable. During an underwhelming run from 2002’s ‘Come With Us’ to 2007’s ‘We Are The Night’, you knew what to expect: guest singers like Kele Okereke (‘Believe’) or Richard Ashcroft (‘The Test’), and mass-appeal beats. Their music remained enjoyable, in a frenetic kind of way, but it lacked the innovation of their first records. Consequently, 2010’s ‘Further’, a record that saw them ditch the guests in favour of something deeper, darker and weirder, was very welcome indeed.\\nCollaborators return for ‘Born In The Echoes’, the pair’s eighth album and first since ‘Further’. But here the Brothers largely bend the singers to their will, their voices subservient to the power of the songs.\\nSt Vincent’s contribution to ‘Under Neon Lights’, for example, is chilling (“And she moves to suicide / In and under neon lights”), her voice eventually cut to electronic shreds and fed stuttering back into the mix like a malfunctioning car alarm. They pull a similar trick with London singer Ali Love (who guested on ‘We Are The Night’ single ‘Do It Again’) on ‘EML Ritual’, his vocals pitch-shifted and layered to create the unsettling effect of too many late nights, echoing lyrics about losing your mind (“I don’t know what to do / I’m going to lose my mind”).\\nThese two tracks brilliantly marry ‘Further’’s brooding electronica with the unsettling feel of the darkest psych-rock. But the real highlights are those that sound least like anything the Chems have done previously, as they burrow further down the rabbit hole, emerging somewhere between early Pink Floyd, minimal techno oddball Ricardo Villalobos and experimental London electro group White Noise, who formed in 1968.\\n‘I’ll See You There’ takes them closer than ever to the perennial psychedelic touchstone of The Beatles’ ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’ by combining live-sounding (and ferociously funky) electronic drums with spectral effects and rolling keyboards. The result sounds like a Tame Impala jam fed through the Chems’ motherboard. ‘Taste of Honey’ is odder still, coming on like the kind of obscure gem you’d uncover on a small-selling seven-inch from 1968, a droning psych-pop tune punctuated by distressed violin and the sound of a bee. ‘Born In The Echoes’ (featuring Cate Le Bon), meanwhile, brings to mind someone practicing loudly on a new synth over Broadcast’s ‘Pendulum’. \\nThis section of electro-psych wonder culminates in the fantastic ‘Radiate’, a brutally touching digital torch song that sounds like Daft Punk coming to terms with a particularly nasty break up, all electronic fuzz, wonky orchestration and heartfelt vocals from Rowlands (“What is this / That I can see? / Just radiate / Your love to me“). It would be the perfect ending but instead, it gives way to the underwhelming ‘Wide Open’. Marrying a burbling house beat to Beck’s melancholic vocal, it’s out of step with the album’s meaty, dark feel. ‘Go’ (with Q-Tip) is equally ill fitting, its niggling acid hooks and strident bass let down by a horrible chorus full of faux inspirational gunk (“No time to rest / Just do your best”).\\nThankfully, it doesn’t matter too much: ‘Born In The Echoes’ is a bold reinvention of the Chemical Brothers’ sound, pushing the late-period renaissance that ‘Further’ heralded to somewhere dark and twisted.\\nBen Cardew\\n Related TopicsThe Chemical Brothers   Search ReviewsAlbum Reviews The Chemical Brothers – ‘Born In The Echoes’ The dance duo boldly reinvent their sound, breaking into darker and more twisted territory than ever before By Ben Cardew 7th July 2015 \\n\\n The Chemical Brothers are arguably one of the most important groups in dance history.

       "\"  Search ReviewsAlbum Reviews The Flaming Lips –\\xa0‘With A Little Help From My Fwends’ Miley Cyrus steals the show as the Lips and guest cover Sgt Pepper...' in its entirety  By Kevin EG Perry 27th October 2014 \\n\\n The thing about pitching an album as “It’s ‘Sgt Pepper…’ but on acid” is that ‘Sgt Pepper…’ is already very much “on acid”, emerging as it did from The Beatles’ most psychedelic period. Still, if there’s one band in the world willing to go the extra tab, it’s The Flaming Lips. They are, after all, the people whose past releases include a USB stick buried inside a sweet gummy skull, and ‘Zaireeka’ –\\xa0a record that could only be properly listened to by rigging up four stereo systems in the same room. That they’re still pulling off high-concept weirdness 30 years into their career is testament to the fact that they remain a bunch of fearless freaks.

Still, if there’s one band in the world willing to go the extra tab, it’s The Flaming Lips. They are, after all, the people whose past releases include a USB stick buried inside a sweet gummy skull, and ‘Zaireeka’ –\\xa0a record that could only be properly listened to by rigging up four stereo systems in the same room. That they’re still pulling off high-concept weirdness 30 years into their career is testament to the fact that they remain a bunch of fearless freaks.

       "'  Search ReviewsAlbum Reviews Angel Olsen – ‘Burn Your Fire For No Witness’ Missouri-born singer turns emotional pain into a positive on her second album By Al Horner 17th February 2014 \\n\\n Angel Olsen is only just releasing her second full-length album, but the Missouri-born guitarist already has a fully formed personal philosophy: “No-one will ever be you for yourself”, she sang gravely on ‘The Sky Opened Up’, from 2012’s largely acoustic ‘Half Way Home’. Released on tiny North Carolina indie Bathetic, the album’s word-of-mouth success invited her to a comparably bigger deal with Jagjaguwar, who are putting out ‘Burn Your Fire For No Witness’.\\nIts title is a biblically bold declaration accompanied by 11 songs that put the 27-year-old’s worldview in no uncertain terms: disinterested in the attentions of others and steadfastly committed to honouring her own intentions and experience. That perhaps makes it sound like Savages’ unwavering manifesto, but Olsen’s approach is rounded by human fallibility, recalling a fabled line from Leonard Cohen’s ‘Anthem’: “There is a crack in everything/That’s how the light gets in”. \\nWith Olsen’s Weimar cabaret-worthy voice and gently woven guitar, ‘Halfway Home’ could have passed for a long-lost classic from an age before electric recordings, sounding haunted by ghosts. ‘Burn…’ is her first album recorded with a full band, though the resultant fuzzily glam swagger doesn’t forsake her wise style, instead coming off like Bill Callahan covering T Rex. Hiring John Congleton to produce was the perfect choice: as evinced on his work with Callahan and St Vincent, he has no signature sound beyond pristine, crisp recording, preserving the purity of Olsen’s vision.\\nHer newfound musical directness translates into the songwriting: much of ‘Burn…’ exists in the aftermath of various palpable betrayals, which Olsen confronts swiftly and cuttingly, breaking beyond the internal dialogues of ‘Halfway Home’ and letting her deeply relatable scattershot responses spill out. On seething opener ‘Unfucktheworld’, she raises a glass brimming with sarcasm to “thinking that it all meant so much more”, and finally snaps on ‘Stars’, where she’s so furious, she threatens to “scream the stars out of the universe” with Maria Callas’ verve. But a few deep breaths later, she realises she could take this incident and use it to “sing the stars into the universe”.\\nThat’s where the light gets into Olsen’s work: beyond her gorgeous guitar, whether sawdust punk, reverb-laden slow dance or near-silent reverie, it’s in the way she’s been steeled by sorrow, a process of galvanising that never ends. It’s tough, as the crushed ‘White Fire’ makes plain, but eventually you’ll gather the strength to stare sadness in the face and laugh: the jaunty ‘Hi-Five’ is a comic paean to lost souls wallowing in self-pity. To get to that point, “all you need is one good thought strong in your mind”, she sings on ‘Lights Out’, a waltzing, rallying country torch song. The sublime ‘Burn…’ is testament that Olsen’s philosophy of self-belief pays off. \\nLaura Snapes\\n Related TopicsVarious Artists   Search ReviewsAlbum Reviews Angel Olsen – ‘Burn Your Fire For No Witness’ Missouri-born singer turns emotional pain into a positive on her second album By Al Horner 17th February 2014 \\n\\n Angel Olsen is only just releasing her second full-length album, but the Missouri-born guitarist already has a fully formed personal philosophy: “No-one will ever be you for yourself”, she sang gravely on ‘The Sky Opened Up’, from 2012’s largely acoustic ‘Half Way Home’.

       "'Arlo Parks. CREDIT: Alex Kurun Arlo Parks’ rise feels very timely indeed. Her music is like a warm hug, a reassurance that everything is going to be OK when the world is dark and things seem out of control. True to form, her debut album is a sanctuary of compassionate lyricism and groove-along tunes.\\n\\nRead More:\\xa0On the cover – Arlo Parks: “I feel like I’m 10 and 100 at once”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile 2020 may have been a write-off for most, it certainly was a good year for the 20-year-old west Londoner. She released a stream of well-received singles, was named BBC Music Introducing Artist of the Year, appeared on the cover of NME and featured on a playlist by Michelle Obama. Most importantly however, she became an advocate for the mental health charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably), which sent a powerful message of unity to her young fanbase. Languid breakout single ‘Hurt’, which appears here, epitomises Parks’ music as a soothing balm: “I know you can’t let go of anything at the moment / Just know it would hurt so, won’t hurt so much forever.”\\n\\n\\nDespite the deceptively soothing nature of her sound – soft neo-soul, acoustic guitar, that honeyed voice – Parks is an artist challenging received wisdom about mental health, a champion of free expression of self. She broke through in 2018 with the dreamy ‘Cola’, a disarmingly intimate tale of infidelity through poetic lyrics (“I miss the way you dressed all punk / With the black and the studs and the ripped up gloves / Bet she loved your tough-guy front”), illustrating complex emotions through an accessible medium – and was duly catapulted to indie stardom.\\nWritten in the same bedroom where she recorded most of her demos, and utilising old diaries and notebooks, ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’ is made up of daydream musings over jazz-meets-pop instrumentals. The 12-song collection feels more refined than her previous EPs, with slicker production from her label Transgressive, whose signees include Foals, Loyle Carner and Marika Hackman, yet maintains the intimacy that grabbed so many at the start of her career.\\nAdvertisement The album is laced with references to artists who influenced her, from Sylvia Plath to Robert Smith (on the irresistible ‘Eugene’, she wryly notes, “[You] read him Sylvia Plath / I thought that that was our thing)”, and Parks has described the album as “a series of vignettes and intimate portraits surrounding my adolescence and the people that shaped it. It is rooted in storytelling and nostalgia – I want it to feel both universal and hyper-specific.”\\nThis is evident from the opening title track. A spoken-word piece that underpins the sentiment of the whole record, ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’ is a poignant reflection on finding beauty in pain, embracing emotional turbulence and speaking openly about your feelings. We are all learning to trust our bodies, making peace with our own distortions,” Parks recites over stripped-back guitars and gently flowing synths, “You shouldn’t be afraid to cry in front of me”.\\nParks has a singular talent for tapping into sadness and turning it into something uplifting. Last year, NME named ‘Black Dog’, a track about depression, 2020’s “most devastating song”; with lines such as “Sometimes it seems like you won’t survive this / And honestly it’s terrifying,” it’s a brilliantly and sometimes painfully honest song. Meanwhile, tracks the likes of ‘Eugene’, which is about being in love with your straight friend – Parks is openly bisexual – and ‘For Violet’, which explores familial disapproval, further explore universal coming-of-age struggles.\\nWhenever she touches upon difficult subjects, though, Parks provides a voice of empathy and wisdom. ‘Hope’ channels the likes of Blood Orange with layered harmonies and psychedelic guitar riffs, while she sings, “You’re not alone / Like you think you are / We all have scars / I know it’s hard / You’re not alone.” Further into the track, there’s a resurrection of her spoken-word delivery as she earnestly addresses the listener: “I cannot communicate the depth of the feeling / Truth is I’m still learning to be open about this.”\\nToo Good’ adds a greater feeling of lightness to counteract darker themes, bringing texture to the collection. Backed by bouncy guitars, funky basslines and catchy pop hooks, Parks sings an infectious chorus: “I think you know it / Too cool to show it / Babe, you’re so good / You’re too good to be true.” Then there’s the stunning ‘Green Eyes’, which was co-written with new-gen icon Clairo and sees the pair reflect on social attitudes towards same-sex relationships: “Some of these folks wanna make you cry / But you gotta trust how you feel inside and shine.”\\nThe closing track, ‘Portra 400’, rounds off this vivid portrait of young adulthood through delicate instrumentals and lines such as “Making rainbows, out of something painful / Getting fried as hell / And dodging gravestones.” This finale perfectly summarises the profound thought patterns interwoven throughout ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’.\\nAdvertisement  \\nArlo Parks may be the voice of Gen Z, but there’s no doubt that this is a universal collection of stories that’ll provide solace for listeners of all ages and backgrounds for decades to come.\\nDetails\\n\\nRelease date:\\xa0January 29\\nRecord label: Beatnik,\\xa0Transgressive\\n \\nWhile 2020 may have been a write-off for most, it certainly was a good year for the 20-year-old west Londoner.

Languid breakout single ‘Hurt’, which appears here, epitomises Parks’ music as a soothing balm: “I know you can’t let go of anything at the moment / Just know it would hurt so, won’t hurt so much forever.”\\n\\n\\nDespite the deceptively soothing nature of her sound – soft neo-soul, acoustic guitar, that honeyed voice – Parks is an artist challenging received wisdom about mental health, a champion of free expression of self. She broke through in 2018 with the dreamy ‘Cola’, a disarmingly intimate tale of infidelity through poetic lyrics (“I miss the way you dressed all punk / With the black and the studs and the ripped up gloves / Bet she loved your tough-guy front”), illustrating complex emotions through an accessible medium – and was duly catapulted to indie stardom.\\nWritten in the same bedroom where she recorded most of her demos, and utilising old diaries and notebooks, ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’ is made up of daydream musings over jazz-meets-pop instrumentals. The 12-song collection feels more refined than her previous EPs, with slicker production from her label Transgressive, whose signees include Foals, Loyle Carner and Marika Hackman, yet maintains the intimacy that grabbed so many at the start of her career.\\nAdvertisement The album is laced with references to artists who influenced her, from Sylvia Plath to Robert Smith (on the irresistible ‘Eugene’, she wryly notes, “[You] read him Sylvia Plath / I thought that that was our thing)”, and Parks has described the album as “a series of vignettes and intimate portraits surrounding my adolescence and the people that shaped it. It is rooted in storytelling and nostalgia – I want it to feel both universal and hyper-specific.”\\nThis is evident from the opening title track. A spoken-word piece that underpins the sentiment of the whole record, ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’ is a poignant reflection on finding beauty in pain, embracing emotional turbulence and speaking openly about your feelings. We are all learning to trust our bodies, making peace with our own distortions,” Parks recites over stripped-back guitars and gently flowing synths, “You shouldn’t be afraid to cry in front of me”.\\nParks has a singular talent for tapping into sadness and turning it into something uplifting. Last year, NME named ‘Black Dog’, a track about depression, 2020’s “most devastating song”; with lines such as “Sometimes it seems like you won’t survive this / And honestly it’s terrifying,” it’s a brilliantly and sometimes painfully honest song. Meanwhile, tracks the likes of ‘Eugene’, which is about being in love with your straight friend – Parks is openly bisexual – and ‘For Violet’, which explores familial disapproval, further explore universal coming-of-age struggles.\\nWhenever she touches upon difficult subjects, though, Parks provides a voice of empathy and wisdom. ‘Hope’ channels the likes of Blood Orange with layered harmonies and psychedelic guitar riffs, while she sings, “You’re not alone / Like you think you are / We all have scars / I know it’s hard / You’re not alone.” Further into the track, there’s a resurrection of her spoken-word delivery as she earnestly addresses the listener: “I cannot communicate the depth of the feeling / Truth is I’m still learning to be open about this.”\\nToo Good’ adds a greater feeling of lightness to counteract darker themes, bringing texture to the collection. Backed by bouncy guitars, funky basslines and catchy pop hooks, Parks sings an infectious chorus: “I think you know it / Too cool to show it / Babe, you’re so good / You’re too good to be true.” Then there’s the stunning ‘Green Eyes’, which was co-written with new-gen icon Clairo and sees the pair reflect on social attitudes towards same-sex relationships: “Some of these folks wanna make you cry / But you gotta trust how you feel inside and shine.”\\nThe closing track, ‘Portra 400’, rounds off this vivid portrait of young adulthood through delicate instrumentals and lines such as “Making rainbows, out of something painful / Getting fried as hell / And dodging gravestones.” This finale perfectly summarises the profound thought patterns interwoven throughout ‘Collapsed In Sunbeams’.\\nAdvertisement  \\nArlo Parks may be the voice of Gen Z, but there’s no doubt that this is a universal collection of stories that’ll provide solace for listeners of all ages and backgrounds for decades to come.  \\nWhile 2020 may have been a write-off for most, it certainly was a good year for the 20-year-old west Londoner.

       "' The Chemical Brothers are arguably one of the most important groups in dance history. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons’ peerless ‘Dig Your Own Hole’ introduced rock and psychedelia to dance music’s palette in 1997, and they pioneered combining indie vocalists with big beats on early records like scorching Noel Gallagher collaborations ‘Setting Sun’ (1997) and ‘Let Forever Be’ (1999).\\nBut for a while in the 2000s, they threatened to become one of the most predictable. During an underwhelming run from 2002’s ‘Come With Us’ to 2007’s ‘We Are The Night’, you knew what to expect: guest singers like Kele Okereke (‘Believe’) or Richard Ashcroft (‘The Test’), and mass-appeal beats. Their music remained enjoyable, in a frenetic kind of way, but it lacked the innovation of their first records. Consequently, 2010’s ‘Further’, a record that saw them ditch the guests in favour of something deeper, darker and weirder, was very welcome indeed.\\nCollaborators return for ‘Born In The Echoes’, the pair’s eighth album and first since ‘Further’. But here the Brothers largely bend the singers to their will, their voices subservient to the power of the songs.\\nSt Vincent’s contribution to ‘Under Neon Lights’, for example, is chilling (“And she moves to suicide / In and under neon lights”), her voice eventually cut to electronic shreds and fed stuttering back into the mix like a malfunctioning car alarm. They pull a similar trick with London singer Ali Love (who guested on ‘We Are The Night’ single ‘Do It Again’) on ‘EML Ritual’, his vocals pitch-shifted and layered to create the unsettling effect of too many late nights, echoing lyrics about losing your mind (“I don’t know what to do / I’m going to lose my mind”).\\nThese two tracks brilliantly marry ‘Further’’s brooding electronica with the unsettling feel of the darkest psych-rock. But the real highlights are those that sound least like anything the Chems have done previously, as they burrow further down the rabbit hole, emerging somewhere between early Pink Floyd, minimal techno oddball Ricardo Villalobos and experimental London electro group White Noise, who formed in 1968.\\n‘I’ll See You There’ takes them closer than ever to the perennial psychedelic touchstone of The Beatles’ ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’ by combining live-sounding (and ferociously funky) electronic drums with spectral effects and rolling keyboards. The result sounds like a Tame Impala jam fed through the Chems’ motherboard. ‘Taste of Honey’ is odder still, coming on like the kind of obscure gem you’d uncover on a small-selling seven-inch from 1968, a droning psych-pop tune punctuated by distressed violin and the sound of a bee. ‘Born In The Echoes’ (featuring Cate Le Bon), meanwhile, brings to mind someone practicing loudly on a new synth over Broadcast’s ‘Pendulum’. \\nThis section of electro-psych wonder culminates in the fantastic ‘Radiate’, a brutally touching digital torch song that sounds like Daft Punk coming to terms with a particularly nasty break up, all electronic fuzz, wonky orchestration and heartfelt vocals from Rowlands (“What is this / That I can see? / Just radiate / Your love to me“). It would be the perfect ending but instead, it gives way to the underwhelming ‘Wide Open’. Marrying a burbling house beat to Beck’s melancholic vocal, it’s out of step with the album’s meaty, dark feel. ‘Go’ (with Q-Tip) is equally ill fitting, its niggling acid hooks and strident bass let down by a horrible chorus full of faux inspirational gunk (“No time to rest / Just do your best”).\\nThankfully, it doesn’t matter too much: ‘Born In The Echoes’ is a bold reinvention of the Chemical Brothers’ sound, pushing the late-period renaissance that ‘Further’ heralded to somewhere dark and twisted.'"

       "\"Meg Remy and U.S. Girls are back. CREDIT: Press For more than 10 years Toronto-based American musician Meg Remy has released avant-pop records in abundance. Her musical arc has moved from no-wave lo-fi (‘Introducing’ [2008] and ‘Go Grey’ [2010]) to more tuneful creations that trace 1960s-style pop, glam rock, funk, disco, punk and noir (‘Half Free’ [2015] and ‘In A Poem Unlimited’ [2018]).\\nIt’s evident that Remy’s decision to progressively imbue her songs with more popular music tropes has been a good one and so have her experiments using multiple narrative voices instead of hers alone. This more holistic direction was the point at which many came to know Remy’s solo project. ‘In A Poem Unlimited’ was undoubtedly the Chicago native’s finest and most accessible work, packed with slick, danceable soul bangers that ran with the voices of ‘Half Free’’s marginalised female characters.\\nYou’d be forgiven, then, for wanting that quality sustained or enhanced on ‘Heavy Light’. Opener ‘4 American Dollars’ belies the impression that Remy’s newest effort is stuffed with songs like its big sister ‘In A Poem Unlimited’. A Motown-style backing vocal group, decadent strings, syncopated beats and funk riffs set the backdrop to Remy’s theatrical alto. A five-minute meditation on late capitalism (“I don’t believe in pennies and nickels… No dinero!”) is the album’s early frontrunner.\\n\\n‘Overtime’ persists with the same kind of sheen (it’s a soul-pop reworking of a song from Remy’s 2013 EP ‘Free Advice Column’) as does the multi-lingual ‘And Yet It Moves / Y Se Mueve’ with bombastic samba grooves, mallet chimes and buzzy basslines. Remy’s fascination with government control looms large on the latter: “They lie to us about everything, don’t they?”\\xa0\\n\\nRemy’s record label describes ‘Heavy Light’ as the album in which she “turns inward, recounting personal narratives with a curious retrospection.” These moments of reflection, such as Remy’s retelling of her and her friend’s experience of watching the disastrous ‘Woodstock ‘99’ festival unfold on TV, might be lyrically vivid but musically they are tedious listens. ‘IOU’ and ‘Denise, Don’t Wait’ also fall short. The latter is one of a handful of tracks on the album that’s adorned with frilly orchestration, but sounds like a formless interlude from the soundtrack to a musical you’ve fallen asleep to.\\nWoven between the songs on ‘Heavy Light’ are medleys of voice recordings where people say what they’d tell their teenage self or recount the most hurtful things others have said to them. These stand apart from Remy’s personal tales as fragments of our collective human experiences. But they also feel like a last ditch attempt to pad out a 38-minute record that already includes three reworkings of old songs. Despite their emotion, they feel cynically designed to thread together the record’s vague theme of retrospection.\\nPenultimate track ‘The Quiver To The Bomb’ is the overarching glue the record needs, a brooding, psychedelic noir musing on how short human history is in the context of the universe’s existence.\\n‘Heavy Light’ sparkles with flashes of brilliance like this and, invariably, in its fresher, more fleshed-out material. But it’s also littered with spoken-word filler and forgettable piano confessionals. Had the stronger songs been contained to an EP it could well have rivalled the extraordinary consistency and thrill of its predecessor – but frustratingly, it falls short.\\n\\nRelease date: March 6\\nLabel: 4AD\\n   Search ReviewsAlbum Reviews U.S. Girls\\xa0– ‘Heavy Light’ review: frustrating filler pulls focus from flashes of brilliance Meg Remy's latest album lacks the slick, danceable energy of 2018's outrageously good 'In A Poem Unlimited' – but there's still beauty to be found here  By Charlotte Krol 4th March 2020 \\n\\n\""
